/**
 * This message means that the player wants to
 * buy a development card.
 * During game state {@link soc.game.SOCGame#PLAY1 PLAY1}, this is a normal buy request.
 * When sent during other game states, and other players' turns, this is a request
 * to start the 6-player {@link soc.game.SOCGame#SPECIAL_BUILDING Special Building Phase}.
 *<P>
 * If there are no cards remaining to buy, or the player otherwise can't
 * buy a card right now (not enough resources, for example), the server will
 * send them a text response denying the buy.  For the robots' benefit,
 * robot clients will be sent a {@link SOCCancelBuildRequest CANCELBUILDREQUEST(-2)} message.
