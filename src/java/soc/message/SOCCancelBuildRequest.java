/**
 *  This message type has three meanings, depending on game state and direction of send. 
 *<P>
 * - When sent from client to server, CANCELBUILDREQUEST means the player has changed
 *   their mind about spending resources to build a piece.  Only allowed during normal
 *   game play (PLACING_ROAD, PLACING_SETTLEMENT, or PLACING_CITY).
 *<P>
 *  When sent from server to client:
 *<P>
 * - During game startup (START1B or START2B): <BR>
 *       Sent from server, CANCELBUILDREQUEST means the current player
 *       wants to undo the placement of their initial settlement.  
 *<P>
 * - During piece placement (PLACING_ROAD, PLACING_CITY, PLACING_SETTLEMENT,
 *                           PLACING_FREE_ROAD1 or PLACING_FREE_ROAD2): <BR>
 *      Sent from server, CANCELBUILDREQUEST means the player has sent
 *      an illegal {@link SOCPutPiece PUTPIECE} (bad building location). Humans can probably
 *      decide a better place to put their road, but robots must cancel
 *      the build request and decide on a new plan. <BR>
 *<P>
 *  This can also be the reply if the client sends an illegal {@link SOCBuildRequest BUILDREQUEST}
 *      (no resources, not the right game state, etc.).
 *      In that case it's sent only to robot clients, not to humans.
 *      (Humans get a textual error message, and can understand that instead.)
 *<P>
 *  Piece type -2 is permitted from server to client only, as a way to tell robots
 *  they can't buy a development card (insufficient resources, or no cards left).
 *  (This was added in 1.1.09.)
