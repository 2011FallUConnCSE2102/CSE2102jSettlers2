/**
 * This is a list of constants for representing
 * types of resources in Settlers of Catan.
 *<P>
 * Warning: Many pieces of code depend on these values and their count.
 *          Clay is first (1), Wood is last (5), Unknown is after wood.
 *          Those are the 5 resource types (count==5 or ==6 (unknown) is also assumed).
 *          Adding a new resource type would require changes in many places.
 *          SOCRobotBrain.estimateResourceRarity is one of many examples.
 * Constants in other places (like {@link soc.message.SOCPlayerElement#CLAY})
 * have the same hardcoded values.
 *<P>
 * Before 1.1.08, this was an interface.  Changing to a class allowed adding
 * methods such as {@link #resName(int)}.
