/**
 * A class for holding and manipulating game data.
 * Most methods are not implicitly thread-safe;
 * call {@link #takeMonitor()} and {@link #releaseMonitor()} around them.
 *<P>
 * The model in this client/server game is: The SOCGame at server contains the game's
 * complete state information, and game logic advances there.
 * Each client's local SOCGame contains only partial state (for instance, other
 * players' resources or devel cards may be of unknown type); and the server directly
 * updates clients' game state by sending messages such as
 * {@link soc.message.SOCGameState} and {@link soc.message.SOCSetPlayedDevCard}.
 *<P>
 * Many methods assume you've already checked whether the move is valid,
 * and won't check it a second time.  For example, {@link #canPlayKnight(int)}
 * should be called to check before calling {@link #playKnight()}.
 *<P>
 * For the board <b>coordinate system and terms</b> (hex, node, edge), see the
 * {@link SOCBoard} class javadoc.
 *<P>
 * {@link #putPiece(SOCPlayingPiece)} and other game-action methods update <tt>gameState</tt>.
 * {@link #updateAtTurn()}, <tt>putPiece</tt> and some other game-action methods update {@link #lastActionTime}.

     * Game states.  NEW is a brand-new game, not yet ready to start playing.

     * the "start game" button.
     * Next state from NEW is {@link #READY} if robots, or {@link #START1A} if only humans
     * are playing.
     *<P>
     * General assumptions for states and their numeric values:
     * <UL>
     * <LI> Active game states are >= {@link #START1A} and < {@link #OVER}
     * <LI> Initial placement ends after {@link #START2B}, going directly to {@link #PLAY}
     * <LI> A Normal turn's "main phase" is {@link #PLAY1}, after dice-roll/card-play in {@link #PLAY}
     * <LI> When the game is waiting for a player to react to something,

     *      PLACING_ or WAITING_
     * </UL>
     *<P>
     * The code reacts to (switches based on) game state in several places. 
     * The main places to check, if you add a game state:
     *<UL>
     * <LI> {@link soc.client.SOCBoardPanel#updateMode()}
     * <LI> {@link soc.client.SOCBuildingPanel#updateButtonStatus()}

     * <LI> {@link soc.robot.SOCRobotBrain#run()}
     * <LI> {@link soc.server.SOCServer#sendGameState(SOCGame)}
     *</UL>
     * Also, if your state is similar to an existing state, do a where-used search
     * for that state, and decide where both states should be reacted to.
     *<P>
     * Other places to check, if you add a game state:
     *<UL>
     * <LI> SOCBoardPanel.BoardPopupMenu.showBuild, showCancelBuild
